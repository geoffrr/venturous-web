PII is not just a person's name or email address, it can include information related to your location, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of an individual.

Venturous Technology may store PII provided to us by our clients and business partners who use our products and services. PII may also be directly collected by you when you register and use certain products and services, and when you visit our website and request information.

As part of our hosting and operation of applications for our clients, we may store individuals' PII on behalf of our clients. This information may come directly from you when you register and use applications hosted by Venturous Technology, to which we request your explicit consent. This information may also be obtained indirectly from our clients who are using our hosting and application services, and it is the responsibility of our clients to obtain your consent.

Venturous Technology will never share, sell, or trade Personal Identifiable Information (PII) to third parties. Venturous Technology does not use or disclose Personal Identifiable Information, except as necessary in the course of providing its products and services to its clients.

While we have implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted via our site.

## Links to Third Party Websites

Venturous Technology does not control those sites or their privacy practices which may differ from Venturous Technology's policy. We do not endorse or make any representations about third party websites.

We encourage individuals to review the privacy policy of any company or institution before submitting personal data. Some third-party companies and institutions may choose to share personal data with Venturous Technology; that sharing is governed by that third-party's privacy policy.

## Storage and Transfer

Venturous Technology provides its products and services from its head office in Canada. We store Canadian client data on secure servers located in Canada. Venturous Technology's servers may be located anywhere in Canada, and we ensure that all servers meet appropriate security and compliance standards.

Venturous Technology may also store, process or access clients' data from Canada for purposes of, for example: responding to client support and technical requests; fixing software issues; or, providing services to a client on the back end of the platform (e.g. performing simulation testing of our disaster recovery plan). However, regardless of location, PII will be protected in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including having stringent privacy and security safeguards and appropriate mechanisms in place.

## Retention

For our products and services that we provide to clients, including hosting and operating applications, we will retain data in accordance with our client's data retention policy and will destroy and/or return data at the end of the provision of services. After such time, data may be stored in an aggregated and anonymized format.

Where we have collected PII directly (e.g. via the website or use of our hosted applications) and not from an individual's client or organization, it shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes. An individual may notify us at any time should they choose to deactivate their account and have their personal data deleted. We will delete or destroy the PII in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.

## Openness, Transparency and Access to PII

Under privacy laws, individuals have specific rights, and we work with individuals and clients to honour this.

### PII Collected by Clients

Where a client has collected PII directly, and has provided it to Venturous Technology as the result of the product or service with the appropriate consents (e.g., hosted applications), we encourage individuals to contact their client or organization directly regarding the request. These may include requests related to:

- Access to information
- Consent
- Rectification or corrections
- Restriction of processing
- Inquiries or complaints

We will provide the data custodian with all the information necessary to respond to requests and work with them to assist them fulfill their obligations as custodians and address your rights under the law.

### PII Collected by Venturous Technology

As indicated in this Policy, whenever we rely on an individual's explicit consent to process their PII, the individual has the right to opt-out and withdraw their consent at any time.

We do not require that any individual provides us with PII. The decision to provide PII is voluntary. Except as expressly stated otherwise in this policy, individuals may opt out of having Venturous Technology share PII with third parties as described in this policy by notifying us in writing of their desire to do so.

If an individual does not wish to provide the PII requested, however, they may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested. Similarly, by choosing to unsubscribe from receiving notifications or messages, may compromise the client experience in using the products and/or services. If complying with a request would result in termination of any services, we will make that clear and confirm this with the individual before proceeding.

- Ask Venturous Technology to restrict our processing of personal data or object to our processing;
- Request a copy of information we hold about the individual;
- Make an inquiry and/or complaint

## Access to and accuracy of information

Venturous Technology strives to keep PII we collect accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain data accuracy. We will provide individuals with access to their information and the opportunity to change that information. The individual providing us with personal information is responsible to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about themselves, and notify Venturous Technology if there are any updates or changes to ensure it remains true, accurate, current and complete.

## Verification

Venturous Technology will engage in periodic self-assessment to verify that it continues to be in compliance with these policies.

## Changes to this Policy

Venturous Technology will review and update this policy periodically. We reserve the right to change the terms of at any time (for example due to changes in data protection laws). We will take adequate and reasonable action to obtain your consent if required, as a result of any such change.
